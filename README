# Hangman Game in Unity

This is a Hangman game created with the Unity engine. The goal of the game is to guess a hidden word by selecting letters within a limited time frame and number of attempts.

## Game Mechanics

1. **Word Selection**: The game randomly selects a word from a text file (`words.txt`).
2. **Guessing Letters**: 
   - Correct guesses reveal the letter's position(s) in the word.
   - Incorrect guesses display parts of a hangman graphic, incrementing a "fail" counter.
3. **Winning and Losing**:
   - Win by guessing the entire word.
   - Lose if the fail counter reaches the maximum (all parts of the hangman are displayed).
4. **Timer**: A timer tracks how long the player takes to solve the puzzle.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open the project in Unity.
3. Ensure you have a `words.txt` file in the `Assets` folder containing a list of words, one per line, for the game to select from.
4. Press "Play" in the Unity editor to start the game.

## Game Controls

- **Keyboard Input**: Use any letter key on the keyboard to guess a letter.
- **Replay Button**: Appears at the end of each game (win or lose) to restart the game.

## Requirements

- **Unity Engine**: Version 2019.4 or newer recommended.
- **TextMeshPro**: This project uses TMP components for text display.
